## Design Pattern: Clean Architecture Repository Pattern
is a structural design pattern that priovides abstarction to concrete implementation:
- #### Models 
  - hold application data. Theyâ€™re usually structs or simple classes.
- #### Scenes 
  - display visual elements and controls on the screen. Theyâ€™re typically subclasses of UIView.
- #### View models
  - transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. Theyâ€™re usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.
- #### Repository
  - provides a layer of abstraction so the implemetation is hidden from implementor e.g viewModel uses a reposiotry protocl to fetch data without knowing the source of the data is coming from either an api or database.

## Dependencies

- None ðŸ˜‰

## Installation

- Just clone this repo and open the project folder's .xcodeProj file.

### Improvements

- The emoji container view can use a collectionView instead of a stackView to support more items and scrolling. However the concept and proof of knowledge due to time constraint has been demonstrated using a stackView with five emojis same as of facebook messenger.
